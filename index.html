      <h1>Short Story</h1>
      <p>
        The fog surrounding me was thick, The air was muggy and all sense of the
        world was gone. 
         As I walked further into the woods it was difficult to
        know where I was going and when I would get there.
       Fear was pounding my
        heart, but there was no going back. I had to keep going. I pushed
        forward struggling to breathe . The track seemed to be endless. There
        was no where to go. Lost in the middle of a cold forest with no food,
        shelter, or heat. That was when I started to panic.<br /><br />
        To be continued....
